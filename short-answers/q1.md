# Question
What's the difference between "semantic" and "non-semantic" elements?

# Answer
"Semantic" means to have meaning. Semantic elements are elements that ~~provide~~ describe the content they're refering to and tell us and the browser how that content is supposed to behave. Non-semantic elemants have no inherent meaning and tell us nothing about the content they're refering to.

Yup! The purpose of non-semantic tags is to group elements together!
